            <p className='texte-b'>Jean Prouve was born on April 8, 1901 in Paris into a family deeply rooted in art and intellect. His father, Victor Prouve, was an emblematic figure of the Art Nouveau movement, both a painter, sculptor and president of the School of Nancy. This group of artists and architects, to which Victor was closely linked, advocated a harmonious integration of art and industry, strongly influencing young Jean. The family home, often frequented by renowned artists and intellectuals, constitutes a true hotbed of creativity.</p>

            <p className='texte'>In 1902, the Prouve family moved to Nancy, a dynamic center of Art Nouveau. Jean Prouve grew up in this environment rich in works of art and artisanal creations, nourished by the artistic influences of his parents. His mother, Marie Duhamel, a talented pianist, added a musical dimension to this setting already steeped in visual arts and intellectual discussions.From an early age, Jean observed the work of his father, Victor Prouve, an eminent artist and educator of the Art Nouveau movement, who transmitted to him a holistic vision of art. These experiences shape his aesthetic sense and practical approach, marrying engineering and design with a philosophy where aesthetics and functionality are inseparable. This intense artistic and intellectual education prepares Jean for a career marked by innovation and humanism.</p>

This immersion allowed him to develop a unique sensitivity which will mark all his future work.</p>

            <p className='texte-b'>Jean Prouve began his apprenticeship in ironwork in 1916 with Emile Robert in Enghien, where he acquired the basics of the trade. He continued his training with Adalbert Szabo in Paris, perfecting his skills in the traditional techniques of artistic metalwork. In 1921, he returned to Nancy and worked for the artistic ironworker Emile Brandt, where he refined his know-how and developed a personal style. These experiences allow him to master artisanal techniques while promoting innovation and quality in his work.</p>

            <p className='texte'>In 1924, Jean Prouve opened his own ironwork workshop in Nancy. He began by creating wrought iron banisters, gates and doors, demonstrating his skill at transforming metal into functional works of art. He quickly became interested in the design of furniture and architectural elements in metal. His first creations, influenced by Art Nouveau, evolved towards a more modern aesthetic, characterized by simplicity, functionality and the use of new materials such as steel and aluminum. His works combine beauty and practicality, establishing his workshop as a place of innovation in metal design.</p>

            <p className='texte'>In the 1930s, Jean Prouve began to collaborate with major figures in architecture and design, including Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret. These collaborations mark a particularly fruitful period of his career. Le Corbusier, famous for his revolutionary theories on urban planning and architecture, found in Prouve an ideal partner to materialize his avant-garde ideas. Charlotte Perriand, an influential designer, shares with Prouve a common vision of modernity, focused on functionality and refined aesthetics.</p>
            <p className='texte'>Together they work on various projects, exploring new approaches to design and construction. One of their emblematic projects is the interior equipment of the Cite Universitaire de Paris, where Prouve applies his skills in metallurgy to create functional and innovative furniture. These collaborations allow Prouve to immerse himself in a network of like-minded creators, which stimulates his creativity and inspires him to push the boundaries of his art. He draws inspiration from the modernist theories of his colleagues to develop architectural solutions and furniture that reflect the principles of simplicity, functionality and rationality.</p>

            <p className='texte'>Alongside his collaborations, Jean ProuvÃ© focuses on technical innovation, particularly in the field of modular construction. He developed manufacturing techniques using industrial materials such as aluminum and steel, pioneers at the time. One of its major innovations is the development of modular metal panels which make it possible to create light, strong and easily transportable structures. These panels can be assembled quickly on site, reducing construction time and costs.</p>

            <p className='texte'>These advances opened the way to prefabrication and the industrialization of construction, concepts which would become pillars of his work. ProuvÃ© applies these techniques in various projects, such as the Maison du Peuple in Clichy and schools in Africa, demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of his methods. Prefabrication not only makes it possible to respond quickly to housing and infrastructure needs, but also to ensure consistent quality and savings in resources.</p>

            <p className='texte'>In 1947, Jean ProuvÃ© transferred his workshops to MaxÃ©ville, near Nancy. This place is quickly becoming a nerve center for innovation in metallurgy and architectural design. The workshops are distinguished by their ability to produce not only furniture, but also complex metal structures for architecture. Jean ProuvÃ© develops metal facades, partitions, doors and windows, while continuing to create furniture that combines aesthetics and functionality.ProuvÃ©âs approach is based on industrialization and prefabrication, using materials like steel and aluminum to create modular parts. This method makes it possible to standardize and streamline production, reducing costs and manufacturing times while ensuring high quality. Its innovations in modular construction open up new perspectives in the field of architecture, notably by facilitating the rapid and efficient construction of buildings.</p>

            <p className='texte'>One of the most ambitious projects developed during this period was the model of a 10x12 meter demountable house, complete with a 2x12 meter awning, designed in 1948. This model was designed as a demonstration vehicle to demonstrate the merits of construction pre-made to a wider audience. The architecture of the house is based on the use of axial load-bearing porticos, which not only structure the space but also allow remarkable flexibility in the interior layout. The partitions and facade panels, whether glazed or solid, are designed to be interchangeable, allowing occupants to modify the layout according to their evolving needs.</p>

            <p className='texte'>After the Second World War, Jean Prouve played a crucial role in the reconstruction of France. The country, ravaged by bombings and fighting, is in urgent need of housing and infrastructure. Prouve, with its innovative vision of modular construction and prefabrication, finds itself at the forefront of this reconstruction effort. In 1947, he designed Demountable Houses, modular structures designed to be quickly assembled on site. These houses, made of prefabricated metal panels, respond to urgent needs for temporary housing while offering durable and aesthetically pleasing solutions.</p>
            <p className='texte'>These projects mark a turning point in his career and allow him to demonstrate the effectiveness of his construction methods in crisis conditions. His pragmatic approach and attention to detail attract the attention of architects and urban planners internationally. He begins to receive orders not only from France, but also from other European countries and North America. Prouve's techniques, which combine speed of execution, low cost and structural quality, are seen as ideal solutions to the problems of rapid urbanization and housing shortages. His fame grew, and he became a central figure in the post-war reconstruction movement, working on international projects and collaborating with other renowned architects to export his technical innovations around the world.</p>

            <p className='texte'>In 1957, Jean ProuvÃ© was appointed professor at the National School of Decorative Arts (ENSAD) in Paris. This position allows him to pass on his vast experience and innovative ideas to a new generation of designers and architects. At ENSAD, ProuvÃ© does not just teach construction techniques; he inspires his students to rethink architecture and design in terms of functionality, sustainability and social responsibility. It encourages a holistic approach, where aesthetics and technique are inseparable, and where each project must respond to real needs while being accessible and ethical.</p>
